# face-and-emotion-recognition
This repository contains a Flask web application that uses a pre-trained deep learning model to detect facial emotions in real-time from a webcam stream. The model is based on the "fer2013" dataset and uses the "mini_XCEPTION" architecture. The application displays the detected emotion on the screen using the OpenCV library.
